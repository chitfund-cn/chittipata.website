    <h1>About Chit Funds</h1>
    <p>
      Chit funds are a popular savings and borrowing scheme practiced in India and other countries. They operate as a type of rotating savings and credit association, where a group of people contributes a fixed amount of money every month. Each month, one member takes the collected sum through a bidding or lottery process.
    </p>
    <h2>How Chit Funds Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A group (called a "chit group") is formed with a fixed number of members and a tenure.</li>
      <li>Each member contributes a fixed amount every period (typically monthly).</li>
      <li>Every period, a pooled amount is given to one member, either by auction or lottery.</li>
      <li>The process continues until all members have received the pooled amount once.</li>
    </ul>
